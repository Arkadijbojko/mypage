These lecture notes are meant to give a gentle introduction to derived algebraic geometry and local models of derived stacks. They are primarily aimed at enumerative algebraic geometers, who want to understand the role of shifted symplectic structures and where these structures arise from. In the process, I prove the deformation invariance of virtual fundamental classes counting sheaves on Calabi-Yau fourfolds under the assumption that orientations exist in a family.
