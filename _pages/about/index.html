My main interests lie in advancing the understanding of wall-crossing theories on the sheaf side and their application to studying invariants and structures of moduli spaces. Most of my work has focused on sheaf-counting on Calabiâ€“Yau fourfolds and Virasoro constraints where I used vertex algebras and their formal families to prove multiple existing conjectures.</p> <p><strong>I am (co)organizing</strong> the <a href="https://wiki.preschema.com/ag-seminar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Algebraic Geometry Seminar</a> at Academia Sinica.
