I work in enumerative algebraic geometry with a focus on sheaf-counting theories. My main interests lie in advancing the understanding of wall-crossing theories on the sheaf side and their application to studying invariants and structures of moduli spaces. Most of my work has focused on sheaf-counting on Calabiâ€“Yau fourfolds and Virasoro constraints where I used vertex algebras and their formal families to prove multiple existing conjectures.

**I am (co)organizing** the [Algebraic Geometry Seminar](https://wiki.preschema.com/ag-seminar) at Academia Sinica. You can [contact me] using the email address found [here](https://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/f59addca-1da6-47fd-9bb8-18d087da6088/pages/20#).
